&lt;p&gt;On the citation graph we’re using, &lt;a href="http://www.mapequation.org/code.html"&gt;InfoMap&lt;/a&gt; identifies 5,292 unique paper clusters. For each cluster, we took the top paper rated by &lt;a href="http://www.eigenfactor.org/"&gt;Eigenfactor&lt;/a&gt; and fed these 5,292 papers as the seed set for the Least Common Ancestor (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCA&lt;/span&gt;) query which we ran on Myria. The &lt;a href="https://demo.myria.cs.washington.edu/queries?max=35111&amp;amp;limit=1"&gt;query itself&lt;/a&gt; took a little over 4 hours, but it finished successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the nearly 14 million pairs of papers, 7.1M of them have a common ancestor—a hit rate of about 50%.  Among these 7.1M LCAs, here are the ten most frequent papers (and their frequencies):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(47,129) &lt;em&gt;Some Methods for Strengthening the Common 𝝌&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Tests&lt;/em&gt; (Cochran, 1954)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(35,585) &lt;em&gt;The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism&lt;/em&gt; (Trivers, 1971)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(34,195) &lt;em&gt;On the Mathematical Foundations of Theoretical Statistics&lt;/em&gt; (Fisher, 1922)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(34,093) &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of the Commons&lt;/em&gt; (Hardin, 1968)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(32,067) &lt;em&gt;Some Difficulties of the Determination Problem&lt;/em&gt; (Harrison, 1933)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(29,458) &lt;em&gt;Diverse Doctrines of Evolution, Their Relation to the Practice of Science and of Life&lt;/em&gt; (Jennings, 1927)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(28,149) &lt;em&gt;An Analysis of Transformations&lt;/em&gt; (Box, 1964)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(26,000) &lt;em&gt;Fitting the Negative Binomial Distribution to Biological Data&lt;/em&gt; (Bliss, 1953)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(25,410) &lt;em&gt;A Method for Cluster Analysis&lt;/em&gt; (Edwards, 1965)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(24,611) &lt;em&gt;A Theory of the Allocation of Time&lt;/em&gt; (Becker, 1965)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to dig into this more next week, but looking at the results is already pretty fascinating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These papers are generally highly cited, but (paraphrasing Jevin) may not be currently recognized as the very top according to standard citation metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time range is pretty interesting — early to mid 20th century all around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathematics and statistics seems to dominate this part of the list. We do see some more fundamental life science papers nearby, the first of which is &lt;em&gt;The Gene&lt;/em&gt; (Goldschmidt, 1928) at #17.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The top hit represents 0.66%, or 1 in 151 of the results, and the 10th hit represents 0.34% or 1 in 289 of the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, of course, I have not directly come across any of these papers in my work, but I should go read them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts: Do you recognize these papers? Have you read them? What else should we think about?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="jevin"></category><category term="sandra"></category><category term="msdse"></category><category term="eigenfactor"></category></entry><entry><title>Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment Summit</title><link href="http://blog.halper.in/moore-sloan-data-science-environment-summit.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Halperin</name></author><id>tag:blog.halper.in,2014-10-08:moore-sloan-data-science-environment-summit.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="#dsesummit group" src="/images/20141009_DSE_Summit_70.jpg" style="width: 924px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last three days we were been at the Moore-Sloan &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSE&lt;/span&gt; Summit (#dsesummit on Twitter). It was utterly fantastic to see all our compatriots at Berkeley and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt;, and to meet new ones. Here are a few random observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main goal of the summit was for community building. By this metric, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSE&lt;/span&gt; Summit was an &lt;strong&gt;unqualified success&lt;/strong&gt;. By the end of the three days I felt like I knew everyone I passed in the hall and I had experienced many substantial, half-hour-plus-long conversations with many great folks from everywhere. Kevin, Micaela, and Sarah did a great job with the planning and the &lt;em&gt;gilded cage&lt;/em&gt; of Asilomar was a wonderful venue in which to be locked together!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since unconferences started creeping into workshop schedules a few years back, I have had a really mixed impression. They seem to work best with small groups where everyone is interested; bigger groups tend to devolve into presentations and advertisements by the two or three people who normally talk the most — thus two of the unconferences felt pretty useless to me. In contrast, the third unconference on the last day was great — about 10 students and data scientists debating real issues around “how to we keep a sense of community and communication going” after the summit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among the scientists with data problems, the groups seemed heavily slanted towards people who are computer savvy. I heard terms like “cache line size” more often than I would have expected, and I heard terms like “data management” much less often than I would have expected. I expect this distribution to change as data-driven scientists from less computationally-savvy domains enter the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UW&lt;/span&gt; seems to be unique among the schools in that we have a substantial and increasing number of people who are “100% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSE&lt;/span&gt;” (Andrew, Bill, Jake, me, plus the data scientists we are recruiting). I will be interested to see whether this difference matters in the next 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill and I spent the hour introducing and taking Q&amp;amp;A about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UW&lt;/span&gt; Data Science Incubator program at the software tools working group meeting. I am excited and hopeful that versions of this program will be picked up by other schools!&lt;/li&gt;
