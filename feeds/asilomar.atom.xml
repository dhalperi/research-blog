&lt;p&gt;The last three days we were been at the Moore-Sloan &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSE&lt;/span&gt; Summit (#dsesummit on Twitter). It was utterly fantastic to see all our compatriots at Berkeley and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt;, and to meet new ones. Here are a few random observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main goal of the summit was for community building. By this metric, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSE&lt;/span&gt; Summit was an &lt;strong&gt;unqualified success&lt;/strong&gt;. By the end of the three days I felt like I knew everyone I passed in the hall and I had experienced many substantial, half-hour-plus-long conversations with many great folks from everywhere. Kevin, Micaela, and Sarah did a great job with the planning and the &lt;em&gt;gilded cage&lt;/em&gt; of Asilomar was a wonderful venue in which to be locked together!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since unconferences started creeping into workshop schedules a few years back, I have had a really mixed impression. They seem to work best with small groups where everyone is interested; bigger groups tend to devolve into presentations and advertisements by the two or three people who normally talk the most — thus two of the unconferences felt pretty useless to me. In contrast, the third unconference on the last day was great — about 10 students and data scientists debating real issues around “how to we keep a sense of community and communication going” after the summit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among the scientists with data problems, the groups seemed heavily slanted towards people who are computer savvy. I heard terms like “cache line size” more often than I would have expected, and I heard terms like “data management” much less often than I would have expected. I expect this distribution to change as data-driven scientists from less computationally-savvy domains enter the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UW&lt;/span&gt; seems to be unique among the schools in that we have a substantial and increasing number of people who are “100% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSE&lt;/span&gt;” (Andrew, Bill, Jake, me, plus the data scientists we are recruiting). I will be interested to see whether this difference matters in the next 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill and I spent the hour introducing and taking Q&amp;amp;A about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UW&lt;/span&gt; Data Science Incubator program at the software tools working group meeting. I am excited and hopeful that versions of this program will be picked up by other schools!&lt;/li&gt;
