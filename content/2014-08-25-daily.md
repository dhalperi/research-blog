Another fantastic hack session with [Sophie](http://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/people/clayton) today. We analyzed the quality and quantity of data in the existing files, including determining which of the 64K SeaFlow samples are within a reasonable amount (say, 1Ïƒ) of the "average" SeaFlow sample according to the calibration beads. Surprisingly/hearteningly, the vast majority of the data is good! This bodes well for Sophie's deeper analyses.

More hacking Myria and code review. Mostly, fixing and improving things we identified with  last week.
