Today we opened up the WRF Data Science Studio to the public. I am **very excited** that we are finally open for business.

I spent most of my day welcoming visitors to the Studio, giving tours, and having a few meetings.

[Arfon Smith](http://www.arfon.org/) from [GitHub](https://github.com/arfon) took the morning off from the big astro conference in town, AAS'15, and hung out with me in the studio. We talked about careers and GitHub and also discussed some logistics for the town hall meeting on open code/data/science we'll be throwing next month. More on that soon.

[Jingjing Wang](http://r.halper.in/coauth/jwang) came by to discuss her paper on iteration and fault tolerance in Myria. Her experiments show that seemingly small system details, e.g., which side of a join the data are read from, can have a large impact on the resource use and completion time of recursive plans. With these great figures in hand, it's time to write!

In the little bit of free time I had, I reviewed many new code offerings that the students put together over the break.
