> Tomorrow I will work more on the scaling issues!

We had a great Myria meeting this afternoon. We discussed [Andrew Whitaker](http://r.halper.in/coauth/whitaker)'s user-defined aggregate (UDA) extensions to MyriaL, which provide a very nice way to get scalable, distributed partial aggregation to implement many complicated aggregations in a single scan rather than through joins. The poster child is [`arg_max`](https://github.com/uwescience/raco/pull/336#diff-bfec5b84bb73fdca4c61627f00d1e6dcR1908): return the entire row where the value of some field is maximized. [Bill Howe](http://r.halper.in/coauth/billhowe) has proposed a nice syntax that might help simplify the expression of `arg_max`-like UDAs.

I presented Sandra's least-common ancestor query to the group, and we discussed optimizations. At the meeting, [Magda Balazinska](http://r.halper.in/coauth/magda), Bill, and [Brandon Myers](http://r.halper.in/coauth/bdmyers) insisted this should work better if rewritten in incremental form, and Brandon helped me rewrite it afterwards. Next week, I'll see if the incrementalization actually helps us scale.
