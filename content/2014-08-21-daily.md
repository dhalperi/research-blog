Today we met with UW-IT to talk about the future of [SQLShare](http://sqlshare.escience.washington.edu). We will be starting some sprints in the fall to prepare it to be transitioned to them as an on-campus service.

Spent a fair bit of time reading and discussing [Brandon Myers'](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bdmyers/) paper using [Raco](http://github.com/uwescience/raco) to compile high-level MyriaL programs to low-level, blazingly fast programs for the UW Architecture Group's [Grappa](http://grappa.io/) distributed system. The initial results look *really* good.

Otherwise, some code review for Myria and other miscellaneous chats about the future.
