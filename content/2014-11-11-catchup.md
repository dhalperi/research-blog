Today, UW is closed for the Veteran's Day holiday; I took the opportunity to continue catching up on several weeks' email.

[Ângela Katsumaya](http://depts.washington.edu/hacholab/labdetails.php?id=58) came to the Incubator for a few hours this afternoon. With [Bill](http://r.halper.in/coauth/billhowe), she continued joining and analyzing her data, attempting to answer questions like "what is the average bed time for each student?" in [SQLShare](https://sqlshare.escience.washington.edu).

On Myria, I reviewed a bunch of the great code that [Jingjing Wang](http://r.halper.in/coauth/jwang) has written and merged some of her new features.

Finally, I also had the wacky idea (based on a question from Ângela) to add some fancy math operators to the Myria language. Would it not be cool if the following was legal code?

```myrial
select * from R where x ≤ 5;
```

I have a working prototype and will bring it to the team soon. At the best, these operators would make the language easier to learn and example programs easier to understand. At the worst, it's confusing and/or misleading -- "How do I type that operator?". (The answer `Option`+`,` on a Mac, in this case).

Oh, also -- Bill gave us a tour of the new Data Science Studio space. Looking forward to moving in there as soon as we can!
