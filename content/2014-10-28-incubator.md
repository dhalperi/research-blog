In this incubator this morning, [Sophie](http://r.halper.in/coauth/sclayton) and I worked on the IPython Notebook -- Myria pipeline. In particular, we pushed some bug fixes to some SSL bugs (but not all the way) and demonstrated an ability to issue queries in Datalog or MyriaL from Python that get executed on Myria!

Sophie is now on her own for the next two weeks (I'm out), and hopefully she is armed with the tools to be productive. Andrew and Bill will be able to help her if not.
