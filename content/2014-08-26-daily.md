One of the goals for our [Relational Algebra COmpiler (Raco)](http://github.com/uwescience/raco) is that it should be a "relational algebra middleware" for many big data system backends. At the moment, we support: Myria (Myria Team) and Grappa (Brandon Myers), plus anything that speaks SQL including SQL Server but also Hive or Shark. Expanding this set will make the middleware vision real.

I spent today hacking on the Raco â†’ [Flink](http://flink.incubator.apache.org/) pipeline. As of tonight, [I can produce Flink Java programs](https://github.com/uwescience/raco/tree/flink) from MyriaL programs for a fairly fleshed-out SPJA subset of the language. I'm hoping that this experiment will

1. help us make Raco a better middleware for big data systems. (stay tuned!)
2. lower the barrier to entry to using Flink (do you REALLY want to write Java code [like this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/blob/ce3ed7e0b769ab3ddc9a96666028ef45f6b01b6d/flink-examples/flink-java-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/example/java/relational/RelationalQuery.java)?)
3. make it significantly easier to compare big data systems head-to-head.  (stay tuned!)
