Very little research today.

[Shrainik](http://r.halper.in/coauth/shrainik) is planning his quals exam and writeup and we are discussing logistics around that.

[Jeremy](http://r.halper.in/coauth/hyrkas) is putting the finishing touches on his accepted IAAI'15 Challenge Paper on "Time-Varying Clusters in Large-Scale Flow Cytometry"; the key question here is where to host the test dataset. The obvious choices like FigShare and Dryad are out because they either don't host big data or don't support the IAAI conference. Looks like we'll throw it in an S3 bucket. Comments??

[Brandon Haynes](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bhaynes/) of the UW DB group is starting to use Myria in his scripts and is uncovering issues in little-used Myria API calls (both in the MyriaX API and in the Python library that connects to it). I spent a fair bit of time reviewing and merging his changes.

I also pushed new versions of [Raco](https://github.com/uwescience/raco) and [myria-python](https://github.com/uwescience/myria-python) to pypi so they are installable via `pip`!
