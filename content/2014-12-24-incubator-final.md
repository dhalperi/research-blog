Our Fall 2014 offering of the [Data Science Incubator](http://data.uw.edu/incubator/) concluded on December 4th with final presentations by the participants in the new [WRF Data Science Studio](http://escience.washington.edu/dss). These presentations, the first official event held in our new space, were attended by over 40 people.
