Started the day with a fantastic meeting with [Sophie Clayton](http://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/people/clayton) in the Armbrust Lab. Sophie is trying to analyze the entire SeaFlow corpus in [Myria](http://myria.cs.washington.edu). Today: she wrote queries to analyze ~64K files at once in MyriaL, which she is logging on [a GitHub wiki](https://github.com/uwescience/seaflow-myria/wiki). We ran into some memory pressure joining two 1.7B-rows (# particles measured by SeaFlow) datasets, but were able to work around it. The remaining queries were on the order of the # sample files and all finished with no problems in under 2 minutes.

The other great part about working with Sophie is what I learn by seeing a real scientist who is extremely competent, but not a database expert, use the system. I generated at least [7 new issues](https://github.com/dhalperi?tab=contributions&from=2014-08-22#contribution-activity) related to making Myria more usable. I spent my productive time in the rest of the day working on these issues.

More code review for Myria.
