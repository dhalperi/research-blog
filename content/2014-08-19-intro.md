I want to start a research blog. I stole [Jake's Pythonic Perambulations](http://jakevdp.github.io/) basic idea and a little bit of [code](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonicPerambulations) to get started, and I intend to micro-blog here in the [Hogg style](http://hoggresearch.blogspot.com/). We'll see how it goes.
