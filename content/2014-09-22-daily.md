The majority activity today was reviewing the proposals we received for the Fall 2014 edition of our [Data Science Incubator](http://data.uw.edu/incubator/). We received **26** fantastic proposals ranging from Astronomy to Statistics (*sadly, no Zoology*), and we are probably going to have to cut it down to 5 or 6. Lots of great stuff in there, so much so that we are talking about other ways to figure out how to support the projects.

The rest of the day was filled with student meetings. [Jeremy Hyrkas](http://r.halper.in/coauth/hyrkas) is back from Google and will be finishing up his quals on clustering SeaFlow data. [Brandon Myers](http://r.halper.in/coauth/bdmyers) is finishing up his paper using [Raco](http://github.com/uwescience/raco) to generate fast, efficient [Grappa](http://grappa.io/) programs from MyriaL code.
