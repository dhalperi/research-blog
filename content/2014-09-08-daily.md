Today we held the information session for the second installation of our Data Science Incubator projects which we will hold in the Spring. It was fairly well attended; maybe 20--25 people came and many of these indicated that they will be submitting proposals.

Over the weekend and today I pushed several new optimizations to [Raco](http://github.com/uwescience/raco) and to [Myria](http://myria.cs.washington.edu) relating to opportunities identified by my work with [Sophie Clayton](http://r.halper.in/coauth/sclayton) last week.
