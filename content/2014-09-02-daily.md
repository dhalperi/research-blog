Some writing/editing on [Jeremy Hyrkas](http://r.halper.in/coauth/hyrkas)'s paper on the challenges of clustering SeaFlow data.

Now that [Magda](http://r.halper.in/coauth/magda) is back from sabbatical (woohoo!), we met to discuss the status of with [Myria](http://myria.cs.washington.edu) as a project at the implementation and research levels. Good stuff brewing, and we're looking forward to all the students coming back!

I started with the very basics of cost-based optimization for [Raco](http://github.com/uwescience/raco) with a particularly bad case that is particularly easy to handle: when computing a cross product, always broadcast the relation expected to be smaller. (Leaving [Paris](http://r.halper.in/coauth/pkoutris)' [hypercube-based plans to handle skew (SIGMOD 2014)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2594558) as future work.)
