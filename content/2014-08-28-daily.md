We had our monthly [SeaFlow](http://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/resources/seaflow/)/eScience group meeting meeting. For this grant the oceanographers have been doing lots of new science using tools like [SQLShare](http://sqlshare.escience.washington.edu), [Myria](http://demo.myria.cs.washington.edu), and [popcycle](https://github.com/uwescience/popcycle), our software for storing indexing and analyzing SeaFlow data. We discussed needed improvements to popcycle and to the [seaflow-viz](https://github.com/uwescience/seaflow-viz) web dashboard (see it here <https://uwescience.github.com/seaflow-viz>) for visualizing cruise performance and science in real time. [Sophie](http://r.halper.in/coauth/sclayton) gave an update on the cruise she got back from a few weeks ago and on our work in the last two weeks analyzing cell diversity in Myria. [Francois](http://r.halper.in/coauth/fribalet) gave an update on the new proposal we submitted to analyze population dynamics in SeaFlow data. Thinking ahead, we talked about [Jarred](http://r.halper.in/coauth/swalwell)'s agenda for scaling up SeaFlow data collection and what needs that would entail for automated instrument monitoring and the underlying data service; and we talked about how to demo "Myria for SeaFlow" to a broader audience.

In the rest of the day, I worked on making [Raco](http://github.com/uwescience/raco) better: adding some new optimization rules to streamline the types of plans that are emitted by the Flink compiler, and hacking/code reviewing with [Brandon](http://r.halper.in/coauth/bdmyers) to get the [MyriaL â†’ Grappa support](https://github.com/uwescience/raco/pull/269) working better, and fixing a few little issues that cropped up.

I also finally implemented, evaluated, and deployed the [50x--100x speedup SQL query mod](https://github.com/uwescience/myria/pull/609) to the bottleneck query in [Dominik](http://r.halper.in/coauth/domoritz)'s fantastic Myria profiler. Now [the profiling UI is super-snappy even for long programs](https://demo.myria.cs.washington.edu/profile?queryId=32305).
