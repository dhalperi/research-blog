I also did not get much time to do real work today. There were three major activities:

1. UW Data Science Incubator applications are due Thursday! They have started rolling in, so I have started looking at them and have started a few clarifying discussions with some of the authors. Getting excited for this second incarnation!

2. Bill and Andrew and I met to discuss how to make the production Myria demo more stable. Some of the basic things like query queues are becoming important now that we have more users. I'll work on that in the next few days.

3. I pushed the least common ancestor query a bit farther by fixing a fairly [major Myria bug](https://github.com/uwescience/myria/pull/619) -- though, note that this was a performance bug and not a correctness bug :). Basically, we were sending a lot of data over the network when there was no need to do so. Fixing it sped up queries by a factor of 4--5, increased scaling dramatically, and dramatically reduced the variation in query time.

    At this point, I think I am finally done with the lineage query until I get to meet with [Jevin West](http://r.halper.in/coauth/jevin). More later.
