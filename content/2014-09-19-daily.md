Today [Sophie Clayton](http://r.halper.in/coauth/sclayton) and I hacked on Myria for SeaFlow once again. We found another few opportunities for language and usability improvements, and made little progress because of an issue introduced when fixing other bugs earlier this week.

In the Myria research meeting, we had both Johannes Gehrke from Microsoft/Cornell and new/future UW database faculty [Alvin Cheung](http://people.csail.mit.edu/akcheung/) at the Myria meeting. We talked about the real apps (Sophie, Sandra) that we implemented with Myria this summer and about future research ideas.
