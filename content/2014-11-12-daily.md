See [today's longer post on resource-sharing](/posts/2014/11/12/public-cluster-private-experiments/) for what I spent most of my day thinking about -- the right way to balance use of our Myria clusters.

This morning, UW's software working group met to discuss our goals, recent and future interviews & hiring, and to organize how we respond to calls for help at the <info@escience.washington.edu> mailing list.

In the afternoon, I met with a CS grad student from the [UW Security Research Lab](http://seclab.cs.washington.edu/images/banner.png). He is using PostgreSQL databases to store and analyze an interesting dataset which I cannot post publicly about. We discussed database design, query authoring, using indexes properly, understanding `EXPLAIN`ed query plans -- in short, how to use databases well. Turns out that even smart, Linux-heavy grad students in computer science departments have trouble getting databases to go fast out of the box! More motivation for user-friendly services like we're trying to put together in [SQLShare](https://sqlshare.escience.washington.edu) and [Myria](http://myria.cs.washington.edu/)...

I also put together a GitHub repository with the new [UW eScience Institute logos](https://github.com/uwescience/branding) and ordered some stickers! Drop by in 2 weeks and pick one up!
