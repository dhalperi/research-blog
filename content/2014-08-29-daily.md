The big news today is that [Myria](https://demo.myria.cs.washington.edu) now has support for user-defined aggregations. I'm excited that we can soon put this new feature to work and asymptotically speedup [Sandra's citation graph analysis work](http://blog.halper.in/2014-08-20-daily.html), which is currently throttled by memory pressure.
