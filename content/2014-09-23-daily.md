Today I met with [Jevin West](http://r.halper.in/coauth/jevin) to continue our discussions of Sandra Anderson's work using Myria to study citation networks. This week, we are digging into one 37-hop citation path from neuroscience in 1988 to law in 1912. Really, really fascinating data. Soon, we hope to be able to automatically identify what the important papers that bridge disparate fields, and when these bridges were built.

In the afternoon, we held the [eScience Welcome Event](http://escience.washington.edu/blog/data-science-uw) for Fall 2014 -- we met all the new postdocs, faculty, and [IGERT](http://escience.washington.edu/education-IGERT) students who will be joining us this year. Now that school is back in session (starting tomorrow) the year is officially beginning, and I am so excited about what's coming up!
