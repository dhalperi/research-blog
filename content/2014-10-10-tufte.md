[Kristin Tufte](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~tufte/) from Portland State University came to UW today to visit some folks in transportation and to visit our eScience and Database groups. Most of the eScience students got to tell her about their work, and she and I discussed the Data Science Incubator and how to get undergrads involved. In her talk, she told us about S-Store, a streaming database with transactional support, and all about her work building [Portal](http://portal.its.pdx.edu/Portal/index.php/home/) to manage, analyze, and visualize live traffic data on the Portland--Vancouver(WA) border in collaboration with ODOT, WSDOT, and related gov'ts. Fascinating, big, messy data problems everywhere, and great output viz.

[Dominik Moritz](http://r.halper.in/coauth/domoritz) & I chatted about his research on Myria's profiler / query execution visualizer and the paper we hope to write about it this quarter. I have been logging a half-dozen ways in which the profiler has helped me debug and understand various system this summer and these use cases should help flesh out the paper.

[Camille Cobb](http://r.halper.in/people/cobbc12) & I chatted about various projects for her relating to visualization of scientific datasets. We're doing lit review and reading up on existing work, but I think we have the gist of two interesting, novel projects to go on.

In my own time, I have been struggling with using [SQLAlchemy](https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy) on Google App Engine to make Myria push work into an underlying DBMS and get much better performance on selective queries.
