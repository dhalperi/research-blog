Today I met with UW CSE undergrad York Wei and [Brandon Myers](http://r.halper.in/coauth/bdmyers) for demos and code review of York's summer Project. York and Brandon have adapted our [Myria Web frontend](http://github.com/uwescience/myria-web) to extend the current support for [Myria](http://myria.cs.washington.edu) with the ability to issue queries to two new backends:

1. a backend that compiles and executes Raco-generated C code for fast, in-memory queries on a single machine, and
2. a backend that compiles and executes Raco-generated code on the [Grappa runtime](http://grappa.io/), which uses the partitioned, global address space model to execute blazingly-fast queries in memory on a large, distributed cluster.

Throughout the course of the meeting we discussed general issues and refactoring for Myria-Web so that it will truly be backend-agnostic and we can deploy this awesome, multi-system functionality on the web. I look forward to using this software for Flink support!

The other exciting news is that [Andrew Whitaker](http://r.halper.in/coauth/whitaker) finished the Raco support for user-defined aggregates and functions. We now have the support that Sandra Anderson needs to issue fast queries over citation graphs!
