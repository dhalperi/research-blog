In October, I visited our Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment colleagues at NYU. The trip was energizing -- New York is such a lively place, and NYU is doing some amazing work. Over the course of four days there, I met with a dozen fantastic students, gave three very different talks to three very different audiences, and enjoyed brainstorming ways we can collaborate better. I came back to UW inspired to keep pushing on building real software that solves real problems for real users, with new problems to think about, and with a half-dozen potential new collaborations to push on. And, of course, spending a weekend I spent sampling coffeeshops and meeting up with old friends didn't hurt either!

### Research meetings - ViDA students
On the first day of my trip, I had a full day of demos from 15 students in the NYU Poly ViDA Lab run by Juliana Freire, Claudio Silva, and Enrico Bertini. What I found amazing in this group is that every single student had carved out a problem with substantial computer science research, real world application, and a great demo. I got to try out interactive demos visualizing and analyzing a number of important New York City datasets: [Fernando]() showed me how [TaxiVis]() exposes spatial and temporal patterns and trends in taxi data; [Cesar]() showed me clever visualizations of subway rides that highlight schedule deviations, the impact of construction, and commuter trends; [Nivan]() showed me how to automatically mine anomalies in large spatio-temporal datasets, automatically finding days with parades, major construction, and hurricanes; and [Kien]() showed me some initial measurements of how much structure can exist in open datasets for cities all over the US. [Fabio]()'s showed me how
