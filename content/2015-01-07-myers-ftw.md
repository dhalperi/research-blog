[Brandon Myers](http://r.halper.in/coauth/bdmyers) rocked his generals exam today. Brandon (perhaps atypically, but appropriate in this case) gave a literature-review style talk in which he focused on work in many fields related to the performance of generated code and hand-coded solutions for distributed query processing.

> In-memory data management (IMDM) systems have achieved query processing performance that nears hand-coded implementations. This paper classifies work on how this is achieved. Availability of fast IMDM systems is motivation for incorporating them into more applications. We survey techniques for co-operation of application code with declarative queries. We find there remain challenges in the integration of high-performance parallel programming with IMDM. We present opportunities for new work in this area, and we describe our work on increasing the optimization opportunities of queries using a parallel language. 

I left the room with a better understanding of the area, a growing appreciation for Brandon's work, and confidence in his Ph.D. success. Read more about his work in [other posts](/tag/brandon.html).

I went home with a migraine and feel asleep early, then ruined my night by waking up at 3am and penning [an annoyed blog post](/posts/2015/01/08/ill-take-that-bet/) about the latest horrible, pathetic excuse for "data in the news" to catch my eye.
