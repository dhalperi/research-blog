Okay, so home season is a HUGE advantage in the regular season. The average team would win 9--10 games if they were all played at home. That's wildcard-level play often and division-champion level play sometimes.

> Come playoff time, home teams in the divisional round are 70-26 since 1990. That’s a 16% increase as compared to the regular season home team winning percentage. It’s an advantage, but not necessarily as great as many believe.

Wait, seriously? This guy says 73% odds of winning is an advantage that "doesn't matter"? You might get close to 3:1 odds in Vegas.

> [40] games were won by the visiting team in the past 100 wild card, divisional, and conference playoff matchups. Pretty much on trend with the regular season average.

... where home field is a HUGE advantage. 

If you [read the article](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/01/nfl-playoffs-dallas-cowboys-green-bay-packers-baltimore-ravesn) you can find almost every kind of data science fallacy in the playbook. Foss cherry-picks data temporally (looking at only the last five years) and spatially (just looking at the NFC), focuses on anomalies, offers no confidence intervals, and shows a fundamental misunderstanding of basic statistics. "[73%] is a 16% increase [over 57%]" -- are you kidding me?

It's a good thing our schools don't use USA Today in the classroom -- they might "learn" something from Foss. [Oh, crap, USA Today has a huge education program; my own school participated](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/educate/faq_edprogram.htm). Here's an idea: assign students to debunk this drivel.

When I start my casino, Mike Foss is the first guy I'm inviting to play. But for now, I'll [take that bet](https://twitter.com/dhalperi/status/553162193332498432)!
