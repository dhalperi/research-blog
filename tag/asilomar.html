<p>The last three days we were been at the Moore-Sloan <span class="caps">DSE</span> Summit (#dsesummit on Twitter). It was utterly fantastic to see all our compatriots at Berkeley and <span class="caps">NYU</span>, and to meet new ones. Here are a few random observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main goal of the summit was for community building. By this metric, the <span class="caps">DSE</span> Summit was an <strong>unqualified success</strong>. By the end of the three days I felt like I knew everyone I passed in the hall and I had experienced many substantial, half-hour-plus-long conversations with many great folks from everywhere. Kevin, Micaela, and Sarah did a great job with the planning and the <em>gilded cage</em> of Asilomar was a wonderful venue in which to be locked together!</li>
<li>Since unconferences started creeping into workshop schedules a few years back, I have had a really mixed impression. They seem to work best with small groups where everyone is interested; bigger groups tend to devolve into presentations and advertisements by the two or three people who normally talk the most — thus two of the unconferences felt pretty useless to me. In contrast, the third unconference on the last day was great — about 10 students and data scientists debating real issues around “how to we keep a sense of community and communication going” after the summit.</li>
<li>Among the scientists with data problems, the groups seemed heavily slanted towards people who are computer savvy. I heard terms like “cache line size” more often than I would have expected, and I heard terms like “data management” much less often than I would have expected. I expect this distribution to change as data-driven scientists from less computationally-savvy domains enter the field.</li>
<li><span class="caps">UW</span> seems to be unique among the schools in that we have a substantial and increasing number of people who are “100% <span class="caps">DSE</span>” (Andrew, Bill, Jake, me, plus the data scientists we are recruiting). I will be interested to see whether this difference matters in the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Bill and I spent the hour introducing and taking Q&amp;A about the <span class="caps">UW</span> Data Science Incubator program at the software tools working group meeting. I am excited and hopeful that versions of this program will be picked up by other schools!</li>
